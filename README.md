****Snake Game****

This is a simple Snake Game built in Python to recreate the nostalgic gaming experience from childhood. The game is designed to be fun and easy to play, with a growing snake that feeds on food items and increases in length. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body as you try to get the highest score possible.
